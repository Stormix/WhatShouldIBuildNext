# HackIdeas - a project idea generator

It's a simple web app that generates project ideas for you. It's a great way to get started with a new project, or to get unstuck if you're having trouble coming up with ideas.

This project itself was fully generated by GPT-3. Read the outline here in my vault: [Project Outline](https://github.com/Stormix/TheVault/blob/main/1.%20Projects/HackIdeas/HackIdeas%20-%20a%20project%20idea%20generator.md).
